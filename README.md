# chatgpt-autoblog

This is a repository containing code examples for automatically generating blog posts using ChatGPT.

It leverages the Pixabay and OpenAI APIs to automatically extract topics, fetch relevant images, and generate content. The system is integrated with a self-hosted WordPress server for automatic post publishing.

Random dates from the past year are chosen to make the generated posts appear as if they were not created automatically.
